# Guessing Number Game

This project is a guessing game that uses the crayons library. If the user guesses the correct number, it will post a "YOU WIN" message in bold GREEN and end the game. If the user cannot guess the number, the program will give the user a total of 10 attempts to get the correct number. If the user cannot get the number by the time the attempts reaches 0, it will post a "You lose the game" message and end the game. The number the user has to guess is 23 and it's already added to the code on a "if" statement. The crayons library has also been used to print other statements such as the "welcome" message(print in bold RED), the "ending" messages(bold YELLOW), and the "number of attempts remaning" message(bold BLUE).
